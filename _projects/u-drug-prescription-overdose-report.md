In this project, I created a brief report on patterns of Medicare Part D drug prescriptions and fatal drug overdoses in 2016. The state-level summary of drug prescriptions data were retrieved from [data.cms.gov](https://data.cms.gov/Medicare-Part-D/Part-D-Prescriber-State-Summary-Report-Calendar-Ye/hjv3-puc7). The fatal drug overdoses data were retrieved from [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/sosmap/drug_poisoning_mortality/drug_poisoning.htm).

The report was created using R Markdown and then published to [rpubs.com](rpubs.com), a free web publishing service sponsored by RStudio. The image below is a screenshot of the report. Please see the full report [here](http://rpubs.com/mayjh/drug_prescription). In the [next blog](https://mayjh.github.io/projects/t-drug-prescription-overdose-app/), I'll create a shiny app to fully explore the data patterns.
