## 38. Count and Say

[Link to the problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-and-say/)

**Analysis:**  
1. This is an inductive process. The *(k+1)*th reading depends on the *k*th reading.  
2. The starting point of the induction is the first reading, which we set as `seq="1"`.  
3. We need to recursively update `seq` *n-1* times.  
4. For each update, we use `list` to record the list of letters in the previoius `seq`. Starting with the first element `a=list[0]`, we count how many times `a` appears in the head of `list`, and record the number by `l`. In the process we also remove `a` in the head of `list`. Then we record the str `str(l)+a` in the list `stack`. Continue until we exhaust `list`, that is, when the length of `list` becomes 0.  In the last step we concatenate the strings in `stack` to form the new `seq`.   
5. Return `seq` which is the *n*th reading.

```
class Solution:
    def countAndSay(self, n: int) -> str:
        
        seq="1"
        if n>=2:
            for k in range(0,n-1):
                list=[i for i in seq]
                stack=[]
                while len(list)>0:
                    a=list[0]
                    l=0
                    while len(list)>0 and a==list[0]:
                        l+=1
                        list.remove(a)
                    stack.append(str(l)+a)
                    
                seq=''.join(stack)
        return seq
```

## 70. Climbing Stairs

[Link to the problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs/)

**Analysis:**

1. This is again a recursive process.   
2. In order to climb *n+1* stairs, one has exactly two possibilities for the previous step: either one reach the *n*th stair, or one reach the *(n-1)*th stair. Thus if we denote by `a(k)` the number of different ways to climb *n* stairs, then we have `a(n+1)=a(n)+a(n-1)` (here we need to assume `n-1>0`). This is the inductive formula!
3. Set up the initial terms `a(0)=a(1)=1` and use the above inductive formula, we can easily get it done via a simple `for` loop.

```
class Solution:
    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:
        a=[1,1]
        for k in range(0,n):
            a.append(a[k]+a[k+1])
            
        return a[n]
```

**Remark:** If one realizes that this is actually the Fibonacci sequence, he could choose to use the explict formula as in [Wikipedia: Fibonacci number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number).

## 344. Reverse String

[Link to the problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-string/)

**Analysis:** Use `head` to store the head of the unchanged part of the list, and use `tail` to store the tail. Then exchange their positions.

```
class Solution:
    def reverseString(self, s: List[str]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify s in-place instead.
        """
       
        L=(len(s)+1)//2
        for k in range(0, L):
            head=s[k]
            tail=s[-k-1]
            s[k]=tail
            s[-k-1]=head

```
