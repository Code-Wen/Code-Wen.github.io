In this project, I created a shiny app on patterns of Medicare Part D drug prescriptions and fatal drug overdoses in 2016. The state-level summary of drug prescriptions data were retrieved from [data.cms.gov](https://data.cms.gov/Medicare-Part-D/Part-D-Prescriber-State-Summary-Report-Calendar-Ye/hjv3-puc7). The fatal drug overdoses data were retrieved from [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/sosmap/drug_poisoning_mortality/drug_poisoning.htm).

The shiny app was created using R and then published to [shinyapps.io](http://www.shinyapps.io/), a free web publishing service sponsored by RStudio. The image below is a screenshot of the shiny app. Please see the fully-functional shiny app [here](https://mayjh.shinyapps.io/medicare_part_d_drug_prescription__overdose/). In the [previous blog](https://mayjh.github.io/projects/u-drug-prescription-overdose-report/), I created a report based on preliminary analysis of the data patterns.
