<b>A Bird's-Eye View of Bird Strikes</b>

In this Kaggle project, I analyzed a data set on bird strikes, focusing on six aspects in the data, including aircraft information,
bird information, flight information, time, location, and outcome. The goal is to better understand the causes of bird strikes and
propose actionable recommendations to prevent such events. See my report on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mayshen/a-bird-eye-view-of-bird-strikes/notebook).
