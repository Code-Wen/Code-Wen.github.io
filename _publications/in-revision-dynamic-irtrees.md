This paper presents a dynamic generalized linear mixed effects model
(GLMM) approach to modeling a multinomial processing tree for intensive polytomous
time series eye tracking data. The dynamic multinomial processing tree GLMM was
illustrated using an experimental study that employed the visual world eye tracking
technique.
