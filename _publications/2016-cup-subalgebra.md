Consider an inclusion of diffuse von Neumann algebras *A* inside *M*. We say that the inclusion has the absorbing amenability property (AAP) if for any diffuse subalgebra *B* inside *A* and any amenable intermediate algebra *D* between *B* and *M*, we have that *D* is contained in *A*. We prove that the cup subalgebra associated to any subfactor planar algebra has the AAP.
