Experiments 1 and 2 revealed that adapting to a male/female face could selectively
enhance discrimination for male/female faces. Experiment 3 showed that the discrimination enhance-
ment induced by face adaptation could transfer across a substantial change in three-dimensional face
viewpoint. These results provide further evidence suggesting that, similar to low-level vision, adaptation
in high-level vision could calibrate the visual system to current inputs of complex shapes (i.e. face) and
improve discrimination at the adapted characteristic.
