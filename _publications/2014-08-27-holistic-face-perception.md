We tested whether the facial-feature integration index, as defined in Gold, Mundy, and Tjan (2012), 
would equal 1 when faces have a range of configurations
mirroring the range of variability in real-world faces, using the
same experimental procedure and calculating the same integration index as Gold et al. When tested on faces with the same
configuration, we also observed an integration index similar to
what Gold et al. reported. But when tested on faces with
variable configurations, we observed an integration index sig-
nificantly greater than 1. Combing our results with those of
Gold et al. further clarifies the theoretical construct of holistic
processing in face recognition and what it means for the whole
to be greater than the sum of its parts.
