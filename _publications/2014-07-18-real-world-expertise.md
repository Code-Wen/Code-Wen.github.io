Here we provide a brief perspective on approaches, considerations,
and challenges to studying real-world perceptual expertise. We discuss factors like choosing
to use real-world versus artificial object domains of expertise, selecting a target domain
of real-world perceptual expertise, recruiting experts, evaluating their level of expertise,
and experimentally testing experts in the lab and online.
