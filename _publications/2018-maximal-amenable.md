We develop a structural theorem for the *q*-Gaussian algebras, namely, we construct a Riesz basis for the *q*-Fock space in the spirit of Radulescu. As an application, we show that the generator subalgebra is maximal amenable inside the *q*-Gaussian von Neumann algebra for any real number *q* with absolute value less than 1/9.
