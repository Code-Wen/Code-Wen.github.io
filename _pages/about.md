Hi there! Welcome to my site. I am a research data scientist at axialHealthcare, where I build end-to-end machine learning tools to improve the well-being of patients in pain. I am interested in using advanced analytics to drive real-world impact.

This site is powered by [one of my GitHub repositories](https://github.com/mayjh/mayjh.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository. The website automatically update when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from [Academic Pages](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by [Stuart Geiger](https://github.com/staeiou), which was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose. If you are interested in using my template, feel free to fork from it!
