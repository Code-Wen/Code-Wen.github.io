Hi there! Welcome to my site. I am a Visiting Assistant Professor in the Mathematics Department of UC, Riverside. I am interested in using my analytical skills to drive both theoretical and real-world solutions.

This site is powered by [one of my GitHub repositories](https://github.com/Code-Wen/Code-Wen.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository. The website automatically update when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from [Academic Pages](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by [Stuart Geiger](https://github.com/staeiou), which was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose. If you are interested in using my template, feel free to fork from it!
