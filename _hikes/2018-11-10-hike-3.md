A great late Fall hike! The sunshine was just perfect. Lots of newly fallen leaves on the ground. My hiking buddy, Xiaoyu, and I were yelling to each other pretty much all along the way since otherwise we wouldn't be able to hear each other with all the sound from stepping on the leaves. We also saw bisons and turkeys at the Elk & Bison Prairie. They were pretty chill!
