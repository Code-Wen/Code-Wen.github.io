I successfully defended on Jan 4th and passed! Yay! (Trust me. I am a Doctor.) 

I went to Denver by myself to celebrate, mostly hiking and taking pictures, didn't brave skiing by myself though. I did the snow tubing, which was way less exciting than I expected, but the scenery was breath-taking. Also, I drove on snow for the first time and returned the car safe-and-sound. All-in-all, I enjoyed myself and was super proud of the addition to my driving record.

See below for some photos I took along the trail. See more photos at my [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bd0b6qplSNo/?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet).
