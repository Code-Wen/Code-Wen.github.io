 This was one stop on our mid-west trip during Christmas break 2016. This was the biggest group trip I organized to date. There were 9 of us. We drove from Zion National Park to view the sunset. We arrived at the park late in the afternoon. After a short visit to the visitor's center. We stopped by a few overlooks, and then began hiking at Sunset Point. The sunshine was just right, for which I was super grateful. The Bryce Amphitheater was covered with snow, which stood in contrast with the bright orange colors of the sand stones. It was an amazing hike down into the Amphitheater, surrounded by the hoodoos of various shapes. The most notable one is probably Thor's Hammer. The sky showed this beautiful pink red and pink blue right after sunset, which added to the surreal scenery. Close to dawn, we gradually lost sight and had to turn back.
