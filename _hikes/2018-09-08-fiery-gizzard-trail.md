Fiery Gizzard Trail is the place that re-ignited my love for hiking. I didn't hike much during graduate school and found this gem when looking for a group outing not long after graduation. We went there in a group of 6 and were "tortured" by the big boulders and sometimes misleading trail blazers. We turned back at the Raven's Point and took the easy way back via the Dog Hole Trail. That was my first tough hike in years and I rejoiced throughout the hike, for both the feeling of sweat and the escape to nature. The trail was closed for most of summer 2018 and I immediately planned a through-hike with Chenxu. We took the tough route and it was indeed tough, but well worth it!
