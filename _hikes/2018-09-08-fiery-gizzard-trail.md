Fiery Gizzard Trail is the place that re-ignited my love for hiking. I didn't hike much during graduate school and found this gem when looking for a group outing not long after graduation. We went there in a group of 6 and were "tortured" by the big boulders and sometimes misleading trail blazers. We turned back at the Raven's Point and took the easy way back via the Dog Hole Trail. That was my first tough hike in years and I rejoiced throughout the hike, for both the feeling of sweat and the escape to nature. The trail was closed for most of summer 2018 and we immediately planned a through-hike once it opened. We took the tough route and it was indeed tough, but well worth it. Along the way, there were numerous rocks and gigantic boulders. Somewhere along the way, we traversed from one private land to another. Iron wires separate the two lands, and the park put a ladder there to help travelers cross. First time seeing this and I thought it was quite interesting. Thanks W for being my best hiking buddy and thanks the land lords for allowing us hikers to trek your lands!

Fun note, a literal translation of Fiery Gizzard would be 火爆珺肝, which is a popular dish in Sichuan. Yum yum, I'm getting hungry now!

I didn't bring my camera, just took a few photos using my phone.

We jumped and fumbled across many of such rocks.
