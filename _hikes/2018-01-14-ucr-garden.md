I visited W and we went to hike and take pictures at the [UCR Botanic Gardens](https://gardens.ucr.edu/). It was a beautiful garden, well worth the visit.
See below for some photos I took at the garden. See more photos at my [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bd9QmyjFLz_/?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet).
