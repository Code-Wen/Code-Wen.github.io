In this Kaggle project, we attempted to improve Zestimate, Zillow's estimates of house price, by predicting the log error between Zestimate and the sale price. Jason worked on this using Python. I used R, in particular the iml package. This package provides very handy functions to perform necessary operations such as cross-validation and parameter tuning. See my Kaggle kernel [Kaggle kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/mayshen/use-r-iml-package-in-zillow-home-value-prediction?scriptVersionId=7592014) for more details.

By the way, we ended up in top 10%, ranked 345th out of 3779. I put in about 30 hours in this project, and I'd say, I'm quite happy with what I learned from doing this project with Jason and JoAnn.
